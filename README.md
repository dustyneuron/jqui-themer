# jqui-themer

An unofficial jQuery UI theme generator

Aiming to be able to build themes for the development version of jQuery UI

# Current Progress (still a WIP):

Generates custom theme css file from a http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ query string. Can only generate any of the built-in themes currently as there is no image generation.

Supports custom-scoped CSS output.
